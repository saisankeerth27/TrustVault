# PROMPTS.md — AI Development Activity Log

This file records genuine AI-assisted development activity for TrustVault. Each entry documents the date, phase, objective, instructions given to the AI agent, artifacts produced, verification performed, issues found, corrections, commit information, and human review decision.

**Rules**
- Entries must be truthful. Never fabricate prompts, results, commits, or history.
- The project must eventually contain at least five genuine entries, including at least two involving authorization/access control and audit integrity.
- Commit hashes and links are added only after verification.

## 2026-10-19 — Phase 0: Requirements, Architecture, and Repository Documentation

- **Date and phase:** 2026-10-19 — Phase 0 (Requirements and Repository Foundation)
- **Objective:** Establish the Phase 0 documentation baseline for TrustVault: requirements, architecture, implementation plan, threat model, README, and this AI activity log. Inspect the repository and Git state, and prepare a safe Phase 0 commit. No application functionality to be implemented.
- **Prompt / instruction summary:** The human provided a master prompt instructing the AI agent to act as a senior architect, Forward Deployed Engineer, security engineer, and AI-assisted development engineer. The agent was directed to build TrustVault across 12 phases (0–11), each producing reviewable work, verification, a meaningful Git commit, and a push, then stopping for human approval. Phase 0 scope was restricted to documentation only: inspect the repository, create `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `THREATS.md`, `PROMPTS.md`, and `README.md`; cover all ten mandatory requirements; document the technology stack (React/TypeScript/Vite/Tailwind/shadcn/ui, FastAPI, Supabase PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy/Alembic, Wasabi, Vercel, Render); maintain strict secret-handling rules; and prepare the commit `docs: define TrustVault requirements and architecture`.
- **Files or code produced:**
  - `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — problem statement, ten mandatory requirements (MR-1 through MR-10), role capability matrix, acceptance criteria, security constraints, deployment requirements, and a requirement traceability matrix.
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — component responsibilities, Mermaid diagrams, authentication and authorization flows, upload/download flows, permission revocation, audit integrity and its limitations, deployment architecture, placeholder environment variables, RLS planning, and failure behavior.
  - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — all 12 phases (0–11) with objectives, deliverables, dependencies, acceptance criteria, tests, and suggested commit messages.
  - `THREATS.md` — assets, trust boundaries, threat actors, 14 attack scenarios with mitigations and verification, and residual risks (including the limitation of a same-database hash chain and the irreversibility of downloaded copies).
  - `PROMPTS.md` — this file, containing a reusable template and this genuine initial entry.
  - `README.md` — project overview, stack, architecture summary, security principles, document links, deployment destinations, setup direction, and Phase 0 status.
  - `.gitignore` — excludes secrets, dependencies, build artifacts, and local environment files.
- **Tests and verification performed:** Documentation-only phase. Automated application tests are not applicable because no application code, database schema, or API exists in Phase 0. Performed manual checks: confirmed all ten requirements are present and traceable; confirmed all 12 phases are documented; confirmed required threat topics are covered; verified README reflects Phase 0 status and claims no unverified functionality; verified internal documentation links; reviewed the full Git diff; scanned staged files for secrets; confirmed `.env` files are excluded and only placeholders appear in documentation.
- **Issues discovered:** The initial local Git repository had been initialized at the user's home directory (`C:\Users\23jr1`) rather than inside the project folder, which caused Git to track the entire home directory. No remote was configured at the project level, and the project directory was empty. Additionally, the human's prompt included live-looking credentials; these were not used, and the human was advised to rotate them.
- **Corrections made:** Initialized a dedicated Git repository inside the project directory, set the branch to `main`, and configured the `origin` remote to the supplied GitHub repository (verified credential-free). Confirmed the remote repository was empty before planning any push. Ensured documentation uses placeholders only and no credentials were referenced or staged.
- **Commit hash:** `87cea0ee21f5606871ba0183e3602ffd94974a35`
- **GitHub link:** https://github.com/saisankeerth27/TrustVault/commit/87cea0ee21f5606871ba0183e3602ffd94974a35
- **Human review and decision:** Awaiting human review and Phase 0 approval. Phase 1 must not begin until approval is given.
